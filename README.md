**YOU  HAVE TO ENTER DESCRIPTION OF YOUR TASK:An AI chatbot with NLP (Natural Language Processing) is an intelligent software application designed to simulate human-like conversations by understanding, processing, and generating natural language. Unlike rule-based chatbots that follow pre-programmed decision trees, AI chatbots use machine learning, natural language understanding (NLU), and natural language generation (NLG) to engage users in more flexible, dynamic, and meaningful conversations. NLP is a subfield of artificial intelligence that enables machines to comprehend human language in text or voice form.An AI chatbot equipped with NLP is capable of understanding user intent, identifying entities (like names, dates, locations), managing dialogue context, and responding appropriately in a human-like manner. These chatbots can be deployed on websites, messaging apps (like WhatsApp, Facebook Messenger), mobile apps, and voice assistants (like Alexa or Google Assistant). They are commonly used for customer support, virtual assistants, e-commerce, education, healthcare, and more.An AI chatbot powered by Natural Language Processing (NLP) is a software application that interacts with users in human language. It understands input, interprets meaning (intent), and responds intelligentlyâ€”either using predefined logic or AI-driven language models. Building such a chatbot requires multiple components: NLP engines, backend frameworks, deployment tools, and optionally, voice and GUI tools.
